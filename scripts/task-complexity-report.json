      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation steps for creating a world map with day/night gradient overlay, including map library integration, day/night calculation algorithm, gradient visualization, real-time updates, and projection handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task has significant complexity due to the mathematical calculations required for day/night gradients, integration with mapping libraries, and real-time updates. It involves both geographic visualization and time-based calculations, requiring careful implementation to ensure accuracy and performance."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Analog Clock Component",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the steps to create a reusable analog clock component, including clock face design, hand animation mechanics, time zone integration, and component parameterization.",
      "reasoning": "Creating an analog clock involves moderate to high complexity due to the need for precise visual representations, animations, and time calculations. The reusable nature requires careful component design and parameterization. SVG/Canvas implementation adds technical complexity."

      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the subtasks for implementing a time zone selection dropdown, including time zone data sourcing, dropdown component implementation, and search/filter functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This task has lower complexity as it primarily involves UI implementation with standard components. The main challenges are formatting time zone data in a user-friendly way and implementing search functionality, but these are well-established patterns."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of add/remove clock functionality into subtasks covering event handling, clock instantiation, layout management, and removal logic with appropriate UI feedback.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity due to the dynamic nature of adding and removing components. It requires state management, layout considerations, and ensuring performance doesn't degrade with multiple clocks. The integration with previously built components adds coordination complexity."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to implement a backend persistence service, including database setup, data model definition, API endpoint creation, and session management implementation.",
      "reasoning": "Setting up a backend service involves moderate complexity with multiple components including database selection, data modeling, API design, and user identification. While these are standard backend tasks, ensuring proper integration and error handling requires careful implementation."
